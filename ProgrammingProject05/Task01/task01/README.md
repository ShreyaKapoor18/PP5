<H1> Task 1 </H1> 
<br> 
Check on GitLab for a folder containing example images. These images are taken
from several open and free studies, articles or other sources. Some of them have explicit or implicit meta data annotations.<br> 
    1. Check the meta data (EXIF, filename, ...) and write a concept which metadata needs to be passed as additional information. <br> 
    2. Your application should take several command line parameters. --import should take a image file name. --print is an option that prints all meta information on the screen without doing anything more. Define – and doc- ument! – the parameter --meta which takes additional meta information. How should user pass these information? You can also split this up in several parameters. <br>
